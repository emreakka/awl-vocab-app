# AWL Vocabulary App

This simple vocabulary trainer works fully offline once the dependencies are installed. All progress is saved locally in your browser using `localStorage`.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Install dependencies once with `npm install` (internet required only for this step).
3. Start the app using `npm start`. This uses a small local script if the full `react-scripts` package is not installed.
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

No Firebase or external APIs are required.
After installation, you can disconnect from the internet and use the app normally.
The included `react-scripts.js` is only a lightweight placeholder. If you have
internet access, running `npm install` will download the real `react-scripts`
package used for development. Without it, the placeholder simply prints an
instructional message.
